                                    The Norse God Thor encounters the giant king Utgaroa-Loki and must perform
                                    deeds for him. The most challenging: Thor must prove his strength. He displays 
                                    his strength by lifting the Midgard Serpent Jörmungandr disguised by magic as 
                                    a massive cat. He raises it high enough for only the cat's paws to touch the floor
                                    He later discovers it was indeed the serpent  and he was able to raise it to almost
                                    touch the sky. If Thor would have lifted it completely off the ground, he would have 
                                    altered the boundaries of the universe.

                                    Thor and Jörmungandr encounter each other once more during Thor's fishing expedition
                                    with the giant Hymir. Despite Hymir's refusal to provide bait, Thor takes matters
                                    into his own hands by decapitating Hymir's largest ox. As they row to a familiar
                                    fishing spot of Hymir's, Thor insists on venturing further out to sea, against
                                    Hymir's objections. After preparing a strong line with an ox head as bait, 
                                    Jörmungandr takes it and is hooked by Thor. As Thor pulls the serpent from the
                                    water, they confront each other, with Jörmungandr emitting poison. Hymir, 
                                    overcome with fear, watches on. Just as Thor prepares to strike the serpent
                                    with his hammer, Hymir cuts the line, causing Jörmungandr to sink back into the 
                                    depths. The tale, found in the Eddic poem Hymiskviða and skaldic poetry, varied in 
                                    earlier versions where Thor successfully defeats the serpent. The story of Thor's 
                                    encounter with Jörmungandr was a popular theme in Norse art, depicted on various 
                                    picture stones such as the Altuna Runestone and the Ardre VIII image stone. These 
                                    depictions often show Thor battling the serpent or its escape by the giant's action. 
                                    The consistent portrayal of this myth across different artworks suggests its enduring 
                                    popularity and preservation over several centuries before being recorded in written 
                                    form in the Prose Edda around 1220.
